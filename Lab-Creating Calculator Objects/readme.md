# Lab: Creating Calculator Objects

## **Objective**

This lab will continue to work with the **Calculator** classes you created earlier. This system is a set of classes that perform basic math-oriented calculations. You will utilize the existing Java and **Math** class functionality to implement these classes and it will provide practice in creating classes, methods and attributes.

## **Overview**

In this lab you will:

-   Implement your methods
    
-   Create a test class
    
-   Test all of your methods
    

## **Step by Step Instructions**

{You may also download a copy of these instructions via the link at the bottom of this page.}

**Exercise 1: Implement methods**

Currently, most methods in the **Calculator** classes return 0. Using the functionality provided in the **Math** class, implement each of the methods by following these instructions.

**1. Scientific Calculator:**

a. Use the **Math** class to implement the following methods.

i. exp() which has one parameter of type double and returns a double [This method will be used to calculate e^x]

ii. log() which has one parameter of type double and returns a double [This method will be used to calculate ln x]

**2. Trigonometric Calculator:**

**a.** Use the **Math** class to implement the following methods.

i. sine()

ii. cosine()

iii. tangent()

iV. arcsine()

V. arccosine()

Vi. arctangent()

**3. Test your work:**

a. Create a new class named **CalculatorDriver** in the **com.javaoo.calculators** package.

b. Ensure that this class has a **main()** method.

c. Instantiate each of your **Calculator** classes in the main() method and call each of the methods above to ensure they are working correctly. Use print statements to verify correct operation.
